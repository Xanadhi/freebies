# Gratis!

A map-based app to find freebies in your city.

Gratis! is built on Meteor and React. The premise is simple:

  * If you spot a freebie, open up the app and add it to the map (its location will be set to your current location)
  * Other people using the app can verify that the freebie is still valid
  * If the freebie is no longer there, people can report that it's gone. Freebies will also expire after 1 hour of no activity

## Stretch goals

  * Earn points for finding and verifying freebies
